# dninemfive's Botswana (Seretse Khama)
Adds the above country as a civilization in Sid Meier's Civilization V.

UA (Pula!): +1 Food for every two Fresh Water tiles worked by each city. Growing cities generate 2 Happiness, and 1/3 of your excess Happiness is converted to Culture.

UU: Kgosi (Great General): Kgosi (Great General): +1 Sight. Grants stacked and adjacent units the ability to ignore Zone of Control and, if starting its turn in Hills, heals them.

UI (Conservatory): Unlocked at Biology. +1 Culture, +1 Gold. Increases to +2 Culture, +2 Gold if there are at least two adjacent unimproved land tiles and to +3/3 if at least five. Tiles with a Conservatory count as unimproved for this purpose, and tiles with Natural Wonders count triple. Tiles with a score of at least 7 (i.e. a Natural Wonder and four other tiles) have 4/4 yields.
